<h1>I'm Brian Gamble, a developer, designer, and coffee drinker.  <mark>I believe in tested, simple, and clear code, and I endeavor to create minimalistic designs.</mark></h1>
<p>For over two decades I've been making a living as a web developer.  A lot has changed and that's why I love technology&mdash;there's always something new to learn.  (My first view of the web was through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> on a Sun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_20" target="_blank">SPARCstation</a>.)</p>
<p>I've also been blessed to work at a diverse set of companies with some really great people, and now I've started a new company: <a href="http://gentlelionstudios.com" target="_blank">Gentle Lion Studios</a>.</p>
